Shopify Store Insights-Fetcher & Competitor Analysis:
A complete Python backend solution for extracting e-commerce store insights from any Shopify-powered website without using their official API. The system also automatically finds and analyzes competitors, and persists all data in a SQL (SQLite) database.

üöÄ Features
Full Product Catalog Extraction (/products.json)

Hero Products Detection (from home page)

Policy Extraction (Privacy, Return, Refund)

Brand FAQs Extraction (multiple formats supported)

Social Handles Detection (Instagram, Facebook, Tiktok, X, etc.)

Contact Details (email, phone numbers, address)

Brand "About Us" Content

Important Links Extraction (Order tracking, Blogs, Contact, Size guide, etc.)

Competitor Discovery and Analysis

All data saved automatically to SQL (SQLite) database

Clean, modular, maintainable Python 3 code with async scraping

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
Scraper: Python + aiohttp + BeautifulSoup4 for fast, async web content extraction

Models: Pydantic for clean data validation

Persistence: SQLAlchemy ORM, persisted to SQLite (default, can be easily switched to MySQL/Postgres)

Competitor Analysis: Industry & similarity-based competitor detection, supports custom extension

Export/Reporting: JSON, CSV, and SQL storage; ready for BI or custom analytics

üö¶ Quick Start (Google Colab)
Clone or copy the code into your Google Colab notebook.

Run all cells in order; dependencies will be handled automatically.

The system will analyze a demo Shopify store (default: https://memy.co.in) and its competitors.

Generated data and database file (shopify_competitor_insights.db) will be available for download.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Scrape All Information
Given a Shopify store URL, the scraper collects:

Product catalog (/products.json)

Products featured on home page

All policies (privacy, return, refund)

FAQs (auto-detected on typical FAQ pages)

Social links and contact information

Brand text (About Us)

Key user links (tracking, support, etc.)

Competitor Discovery
The system identifies competitor brands using:

Industry lists

Similarity and market category rules

(Optionally, extend with web search APIs)

Competitor Analysis
The system runs the same insights extraction on all discovered competitors and relates them in the database.

Persistence
All information is saved, with relationships, to a SQLite database.

Reporting/Export
You can browse, query, and export your results to JSON, CSV, or directly from the database.

üì¶ Output Files
shopify_competitor_insights.db ‚Äî SQLite database with all retail and competitor data.

[store_name]analysis[timestamp].json ‚Äî JSON export of all details for a single store.

[store_name]competitive_report[timestamp].json ‚Äî Comparison and insights report.

How to download?
Use the Colab file browser (left pane) to right-click and download any output, or run:

python
from google.colab import files
files.download("shopify_competitor_insights.db")
or copy to your Google Drive as shown in the notebook.

üìï How To Extend
Switch DB: Change the DatabaseManager connection string to use MySQL/PostgreSQL, and re-run migrations.

Add Data Points: Extend scraping methods in ShopifyStoreScraper.

Improve Competitor Discovery: Plug in external APIs (e.g., SerpAPI, Google/Bing) for richer competitor lists.

Integrate with a FastAPI/Flask Backend: Wrap core functions in web API endpoints.

üîß Requirements
Python 3.8+

aiohttp, beautifulsoup4, pydantic, sqlalchemy, pandas, requests, nest_asyncio, lxml

üí° Example Usage
python
# Analyze memy.co.in and its competitors, save all to database:
analyzer = CompleteShopifyAnalyzer()
results = await analyzer.comprehensive_analysis("https://memy.co.in", include_competitors=True)

# To quickly analyze any store (minimal)
await quick_analysis("https://hairoriginals.com")

# To see a summary from the database
analyzer.get_database_summary()
